The purpose of the code is to create a table of data
from the mimic database where it collects and groups
(mean, median, min, max) the data from charts and labs
of patients admitted to the intensive care unit.
The table contains columns that every one of them
represent an observation (vital signs etc) and every
row represent the time window of the first admission
in the ICU for unique patients.
